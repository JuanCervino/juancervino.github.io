		On a personal note, I am a stereotypical uruguayan: I drink mate every day, I play soccer every week, and I take the opposite side on every discussion. 
		I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Montevideo, a couple of blocks away from the sign that can be seen in the image below. 
		One of my favourite books is the novel 'La Tregua' from Mario Benedetti, which narrates a 'truce' in the tough life of another stereotypical uruguayan. 
		Among my favourite painters, there is Jose Cuneo who painted <a href='http://acervo.mnav.gub.uy/amp.php?o=1670' target="_blank">bucholic moons</a>, and Jose Gurvich whose <a href='https://www.museogurvich.org/museo/' target="_blank">museum in Montevideo</a> is a must-visit. 
		The incredibly talented Jorge Drexler, not only has wonderful songs, amazing lyrics, but also a very interesting TEDx about <a href='https://www.ted.com/talks/jorge_drexler_poetry_music_and_identity?language=en' target="_blank">'Poetry, music and identity'</a>.

		I lived in the beatiful city of Philadelphia for 5 years. This is one of my favourite views of the city, taken from the Springarden Bridge.

		I now live in Boston, a historical city with a magical river that dissects it. This picture was taken from the MIT boathouse, one of my favourite spots in the city.

		I once wrote an op-ed on a Uruguayan newpaper <a href=https://ladiaria.com.uy target="_blank">(La Diaria)</a> in regards to a tax increase:
